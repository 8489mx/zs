/**
 * ZATCA invoice statuses under which the sale is immutable.
 *
 * Signing is the point of no return: generating the signed invoice
 * ('generated') advances the EGS unit's ICV chain, stores the signed
 * UBL XML, the invoice hash, and the QR on the sale, and there is no
 * reset path. 'cleared', 'reported', and 'warning' mean ZATCA accepted
 * the invoice. Editing or cancelling the sale after any of these
 * states would leave a signed attestation (and a consumed ICV)
 * describing amounts the books no longer contain, while the
 * replacement invoice would consume a second ICV for the same sale.
 *
 * 'not_submitted' was never signed; 'failed' and 'rejected' were never
 * accepted, so correcting and re-signing them is the only workable
 * path (the ICV-chain consequence of re-signing after a rejection
 * belongs to the submission package, not to this guard).
