/**
 * Gateway amount and currency conversions for storefront payments.
 *
 * Two rules, applied everywhere a gateway amount or currency is built or
 * verified:
 * 1. Amounts are converted at the currency's own ISO 4217 exponent. Stripe
 *    minor units are 0 for zero-decimal currencies (JPY, KRW, ...), 3 for
 *    KWD/BHD/OMR and their peers, and 2 otherwise; Tap amounts are major
 *    units rounded at the same exponent. A hard-coded x100 is wrong for
 *    every currency whose exponent is not 2.
 * 2. The currency sent to a gateway — and checked on its webhook — is
 *    always the tenant's own base currency. No provider may silently
 *    substitute another currency (a Tap charge for an EGP tenant used to
 *    go out denominated SAR, and the webhook check then passed by
 *    construction because it compared the same substituted currency).
 * Paymob/XPay are EGP-only by integration contract and keep returning EGP.
 * An unset base currency keeps the historical provider default (SAR for
 * Tap, USD otherwise): the defect was overriding a currency the tenant
 * did configure, not the default for one they never set.
 * These helpers never throw on a malformed currency code: an unreadable
 * code falls back to exponent 2, and the caller's existing fail-closed
 * checks (amount/currency mismatch -> review) stay the authority.
