/**
 * Dine-in table-bill totals (INV-TABLE-BILL-DIGITS-AND-RATE-VALIDATION).
 *
 * Pure engine for the held-draft branch of getActiveTableBill and for
 * the pay-at-table total. The bill formulas are the service's own and
 * are preserved exactly — service charge on (subtotal - discount),
 * tax on (subtotal - discount + service charge), taxable base floored
 * at zero — with two changes only:
 *
 * 1. Every derived amount rounds through the canonical engine at the
 *    tenant's book digits (required), never at a hard-coded 2 decimals.
 *    The subtotal and discount pass through raw, exactly as the service
 *    returns them; only service charge, tax, and total round. This
 *    engine deliberately does NOT delegate to computeInvoiceTotals:
 *    that engine rounds every result to 3 decimals internally, which
 *    would overstate a 2-decimal tenant's bill.
 * 2. Both configured rates fail closed. A rate is absent (undefined,
 *    null, or blank) only when the tenant never set it — tax then
 *    means 0, service percent then means the 12 default. Any present
 *    rate must be a finite number in [0, 100]; a garbled, negative, or
 *    over-100 rate throws TABLE_BILL_RATE_INVALID instead of silently
 *    producing a zero or absurd charge. The service-charge percent is
 *    validated only while service charge is enabled: a disabled charge
 *    ignores a stale percent, as it always did.
 *
 * Rates arrive as unknown because settings store strings; numeric
 * strings ("15") are accepted, exactly as the service's old Number()
 * coercion accepted them.
