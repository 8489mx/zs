/**
 * Weighted-average receipt cost. Inputs and result are per base stock unit, never per carton
 * or selected sales unit.
 *
 * Negative-stock policy (INV-NEGATIVE-STOCK-WAC): beforeQty may be negative. Overselling is a
 * supported setting (allowNegativeStockSales), so a receipt that follows overselling — a sale
 * return, a manufacturing completion, a trade-in, a maintenance return, a purchase receipt — is
 * legitimate, not an error. The previous strict throw blocked exactly those receipts. Sales and
 * consumptions expense at the then-current cost_price, so the algebraic blend
 * (beforeQty * beforeCost + receivedValue) / (beforeQty + receivedQty) preserves the book value
 * exactly through negative pools, for as long as the result stays non-negative.
 *
 * Two degenerate cases cannot be represented in a single-scalar WAC, so the function falls back
 * instead of ever storing a negative unit cost (which would corrupt every downstream COGS
 * computation):
 * - the receipt exactly empties the pool (|beforeQty + receivedQty| below 0.00001, the same
 *   dust threshold the purchase paths used; quantities live at 3dp, so anything below it is
 *   float noise): keep beforeCost. The stored cost is irrelevant to future blends
 *   (0 * cost == 0) and stays the last booked cost for any immediate short-sale. The residual
 *   between booked shortfall value and replacement value is not routed to a variance account
 *   here — same loss profile as the previous clamp / fallback behavior, strictly fewer cases;
 *   see the invariant for the follow-up.
 * - the algebraic result would be negative (replacement value cannot cover the booked shortfall
 *   value on a recovered pool, or exceeds it while still short — a price collapse or spike
 *   during a deep shortfall): fall back to the incoming unit cost on a recovered pool, and to
 *   beforeCost while still short.

/**
 * One WAC quantity source (INV-WAC-QUANTITY-SOURCE): recover the true prior
 * quantity from applyStockDelta's corrected globalAfter, exactly as
 * valueStockReceipt already does. The ledger reconciles globalAfter from
 * the sum of location balances, while globalBefore is the cached
 * products.stock_qty, which can lag that sum (stale counter, transit legs,
 * unassigned provisioning). A WAC blend fed the cached counter therefore
 * weighted the old pool by the wrong quantity whenever the two diverged,
 * while valueStockReceipt blended by the corrected quantity — two
 * different WACs for the same receipt. globalAfter already includes this
 * receipt, so the prior quantity is globalAfter minus the received
 * quantity, rounded to the ledger's 3dp quantity precision. Callers must
 * not use this recovery when they passed skipGlobalUpdate to
 * applyStockDelta (then globalAfter is just the cached counter again);
 * none of the purchase/goods-receipt call sites below skip the update.
