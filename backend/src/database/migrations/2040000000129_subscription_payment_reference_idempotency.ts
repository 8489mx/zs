// Item 3 (SaaS platform review). `applySubscriptionPayment` grants a billing period and
// records a row in `tenant_subscription_payments`, keyed by the gateway's own
// transaction reference. Until now nothing checked whether that reference had already
// been applied, and `reference` was a plain varchar with no index:
//
//   - every gateway retries a webhook it did not get a 2xx for;
//   - XPay and Paymob sign a plain HMAC over the body with no nonce or timestamp, so a
//     captured valid (body, signature) pair stays valid forever;
//   - so each replay appended another `durationMonths` onto the tenant's ends_at.
//
// The service now checks for an existing payment with the same (tenant_id, reference)
// inside the same transaction that grants the period, under a lock on the tenant row.
// This index is what makes that check an index lookup rather than a scan.
//
// Deliberately NOT a UNIQUE index: existing deployments may already hold duplicate
// references created by the very bug this fixes, and dropping or merging real payment
// rows is not a decision a migration should take on its own. The duplicates are listed
// in the log below so an operator can reconcile them, and the code-level gate is what
// stops new ones. Promoting this to UNIQUE is tracked as an open item.
