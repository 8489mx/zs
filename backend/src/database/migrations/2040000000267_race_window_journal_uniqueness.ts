/**
 * Race-window journal uniqueness (rank 7, sub-package 7b;
 * INV-RACE-WINDOW-JOURNAL-UNIQUENESS): the posting methods for these
 * eight source types check for an existing journal with a plain SELECT
 * and then insert. Between the SELECT and the INSERT, a concurrent
 * transaction on another connection can insert the same source, and
 * both journals post. Three of the methods even carry a 23505 catch
 * naming an index that never covered their type (manufacturing and
 * food waste name the round-1 index; van field return names the van
 * index) — dead guards, fixed alongside this migration by repointing
 * the catches at the index created here.
 *
 * The index is partial on active journals only (reversed_by_entry_id
 * IS NULL), PDC-style: postSaleEdit legitimately reverses the latest
 * journal and posts a new 'sale_edit' journal for the same sale, so an
 * unfiltered unique index would break every second sale edit. The
 * application-level SELECT guards stay stricter than the index (they
 * return the existing journal even when it is reversed); the index is
 * the race-proof floor, not the business rule.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered: postSaleEdit gets no catch-and-return —
 * a 23505 there means a concurrent edit won the race, and returning
 * the other edit's journal as this edit's posting would be a lie;
 * the edit transaction must fail closed and be retried. Opening
 * balances get a SELECT guard plus a catch in their post methods
 * (they had neither). hr_payroll_item_payment already catches every
 * 23505 and needs no change.
 *
 * The pre-scan fails the migration with a diagnosable error instead
 * of a raw Postgres unique-violation when legacy active duplicates
 * exist: run the 7a integrity checks (DUPLICATE_SOURCE_POSTINGS) on
 * production data first, and repair or reverse the duplicates before
 * applying this migration.
