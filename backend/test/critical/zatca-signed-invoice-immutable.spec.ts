/*
New file: backend/test/critical/zatca-signed-invoice-immutable.spec.ts
Pins the ZATCA signed-invoice guard (Phase 1, tax F3): once an invoice
is signed ('generated' — the ICV chain has advanced and the signed
UBL XML, hash, and QR are stored on the sale) or accepted by ZATCA
('cleared'/'reported'/'warning'), neither updateSale nor cancelSale
may touch it. The old code had zero ZATCA references in the sales
writer, so a signed invoice could be edited or cancelled in place and
the signed attestation would keep describing superseded amounts while
the replacement consumed a second ICV.

WHAT THIS PINS:
- The status table on the pure guard: signed/accepted states throw;
  never-signed, failed, and rejected states stay editable (a rejected
  invoice can only be fixed by correcting and re-signing it).
- The wiring on the real updateSale/cancelSale with a mock DB: the
  guard fires immediately after the locked sale row is read, before
  any other query runs — the mock answers only the sale load (plus the
  currency lookup updateSale needs first) and throws on every other
  table, so reaching any later step fails the test.
- The guard fires for every signed state, and an unsigned posted sale
  passes the guard (it then fails on the mock's next query, which is
  the expected proof that the guard did not block it).
