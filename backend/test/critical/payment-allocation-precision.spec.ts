/*
New file: backend/test/critical/payment-allocation-precision.spec.ts
Pure spec: imports production validatePaymentAllocationRequest, no
re-implemented formula. Run with the backend critical specs.

WHAT THIS PINS: allocation amounts are validated and totalled in the
TENANT currency's minor units. Before the Treasury P1 package the
validator accumulated cents (*100): a KWD allocation of 10.123 was
rejected outright, and a KWD total was silently re-based through /100.
The DB-backed allocation flow (paid_amount writes, FIFO) uses the same
digits through roundMoney; this spec pins the entry point, which is
where a 3-decimal tenant used to be refused at the door.
