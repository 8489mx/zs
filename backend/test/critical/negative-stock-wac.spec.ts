New file: backend/test/critical/negative-stock-wac.spec.ts
Style follows backend/test/critical/cash-drawer-expected-cash-precision.spec.ts
(node:assert + PGlite, imports production code, no duplicated formulas).

WHAT THIS PINS: one WAC policy for negative stock (INV-NEGATIVE-STOCK-WAC).
Before this package, three receipt paths disagreed: purchases-write clamped a negative
prior quantity to zero, goods-receipt fell back to the incoming cost, and the strict
weightedReceiptCost engine THREW on beforeQty < 0 — blocking legitimate receipts after
overselling (sale returns, manufacturing completions, trade-ins, maintenance returns),
even though allowNegativeStockSales is a supported setting. The unified policy is the
algebraic blend through negative pools, because sales and consumptions expense at the
then-current cost_price, so the blend preserves book value exactly while its result
stays non-negative. The pure cases pin the formula and its two degenerate fallbacks;
the PGlite gate pins the previously-throwing path: valueStockReceipt after overselling
now updates cost_price instead of throwing.

THE ECONOMICS, WORKED ONCE (case 2): stock -10 at WAC 5 (10 units oversold, 50 already
expensed as COGS), then 20 units arrive at 6 (value 120). New WAC = (-50 + 120) / 10 = 7:
the 10 units on hand hold 70, exactly the received value minus what was already expensed.
The old clamp gave 6 (inventory 60 — 10 of value silently vanished); the old fallback
gave 6 as well. The old throw gave nothing at all, blocking the receipt.
