New file: backend/test/critical/wac-quantity-source.spec.ts
Pure spec (no DB): imports the production helpers, no duplicated formulas.

WHAT THIS PINS, PART 1 — ONE WAC QUANTITY SOURCE
(INV-WAC-QUANTITY-SOURCE). applyStockDelta returns two different
"before" quantities: globalBefore is the cached products.stock_qty,
while globalAfter is reconciled from the sum of location balances.
valueStockReceipt already recovered the true prior quantity as
globalAfter minus the receipt. The purchase paths (create, edit-apply,
receipt) and goods receipt instead fed weightedReceiptCost the cached
globalBefore — so when the cached counter lagged the location sum,
the same receipt blended the old pool at the wrong quantity and
stored a different WAC than every valueStockReceipt caller would.
This package routes all five sites through recoverWacBeforeQty.

THE DIVERGENCE, WORKED ONCE: location balances sum to 90, but the
cached counter says 100 (a stale counter). A receipt of 10 units at
20, over an old cost of 10, must blend 90 @ 10 with 10 @ 20 = 11.
The old purchase path blended 100 @ 10 with 10 @ 20 = 10.909091 —
a WAC error that then fed every later sale's COGS until another
receipt happened to re-blend it. The helper below recovers 90 from
globalAfter 100 (= 90 + 10), and weightedReceiptCost(90, 10, 10, 200)
is exactly 11.

WHAT THIS PINS, PART 2 — IMPORT-LOT SHORTFALLS ARE RECORDED, NOT
DISCARDED (INV-IMPORT-LOT-SHORTFALL-RECORD). The P0 preorder
conversion already cross-checks lot coverage, but ordinary POS sales
discarded allocateSaleFromImportLots' result entirely. The sales
service now records anomalous shortfalls as pos_audit_events. The
decision rule itself is pinned here; the recording path (which needs
a full sale fixture) is covered by the service change being the
only caller of this helper for POS sales.
