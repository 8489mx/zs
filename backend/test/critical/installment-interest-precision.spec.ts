New file: backend/test/critical/installment-interest-precision.spec.ts
Pure spec (no DB): pins the installment-interest engine at book precision.

WHAT THIS PINS (INV-INSTALLMENT-INTEREST-PRECISION): the engine that
splits a plan's interest across its installments into
accounting_installment_interest ran entirely in cents. On a 3-decimal
tenant (KWD) it rounded a 7.125 interest to 7.13 for the allocation
rows, while postCustomerInstallmentInterest posts the journal leg
exact at 7.125. Recognition then debited the 2155 deferred account
by 7.13 against a 7.125 credit, leaking 0.005 per plan into a
permanently over-released deferred balance — silent, per-plan, and
cumulative across every KWD plan. The 2-decimal behaviour is
unchanged (arch02 pins [13.07, 6.93] for principal 100, payments
[60, 60], interest 20); this spec pins the 3-decimal case the old
engine got wrong, plus the exact-sum property at both precisions.
