/*
New file: backend/test/critical/wac-single-writer.spec.ts
Pins costing unification package 1 (INV-WAC-SINGLE-WRITER): every
stock receipt blends through the one writer, valueStockReceipt —
the purchase, goods-receipt, and import paths no longer re-
implement read-blend-write by hand. The writer is only a thin
shell over the canonical engine: quantity recovery plus the
algebraic blend. The math is unchanged by the convergence; what
this spec pins is that the writer produces EXACTLY the engine's
number from the stored cost, on the real function, against a
real (PGlite) products row — including the negative-pool case —
and that it touches nothing else on the row.

WHAT THIS PINS, driving the REAL valueStockReceipt on PGlite:
- Normal blend, negative pool, and pool-emptying receipts all
  store exactly weightedReceiptCost(recoverWacBeforeQty(...)).
- A zero-quantity receipt rejects (the writer never blends
  nothing); callers guard qty > 0 before calling.
- A missing product row rejects instead of writing nowhere.
- updated_at is NOT touched by the writer: the converged
  purchase/goods-receipt/import paths no longer stamp it on
  receipt. No code reads products.updated_at for valuation.
